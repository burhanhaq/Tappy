## General info
This is a small game I made. The objective is to tap the crosshair and get the highest score possible. As you tap along, the speed of the crosshair appearing and disappearing increases and it gets harder to tap it. Each time you miss, an Android icon shows up at its place which gets bigger and bigger. You lose if you tap the Android icon.
